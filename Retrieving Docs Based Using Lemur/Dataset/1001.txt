System programming (or systems programming) is the activity of programming system software. The primary distinguishing characteristic of systems programming when compared to application programming is that application programming aims to produce software which provides services to the user (e.g. word processor), whereas systems programming aims to produce software which provides services to the computer hardware (e.g. disk defragmenter). It requires a greater degree of hardware awareness.

In short: Writing software that extends or enhances the functioning of an OS, like drivers, system utilities updates to OS'es or even brand new OS'es.

It mostly involves the Memory Management; I/O operations in the broadest sense of the word like networking, file access and device management; process management (multi tasking, process administration, etc.); user<->system interaction methods (both in and out) and user administration. Basically everything that is part of the OS that isn't an application is systems programming.
