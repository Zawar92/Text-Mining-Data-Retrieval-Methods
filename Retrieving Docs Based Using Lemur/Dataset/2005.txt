What is the best programming language for mobile apps?

It depends onrequirements for your application. For example:

- If as better as possible performance is needed,than a low level language like,Assembler, C or C++, has to be used

- If as better as possible UI is needed,than a high level language, like Java, C# orVisual Basic, has to be used

It is recommended thata prototype of the application and its UIis designed with a high level language.

Also, it is not just a question of some programming language. It is a combination of many-many factors and
one of them is a right set of helperlibraries. An UI library, like QT, could significantly speed up the
development process.

In overall, your application could use any set of different languages and helper libraries.
