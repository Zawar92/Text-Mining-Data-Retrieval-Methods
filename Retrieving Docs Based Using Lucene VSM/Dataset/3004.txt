Cough medicines are commonly bought to treat coughs that occur when you have an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Cough medicines are often divided into those for a dry cough, and those for a chesty cough. It is thought that cough medicines do not really work. However, some people feel that they work for them and they are thought to be reasonably safe medicines. Children who are aged 6 years and younger should only be given simple cough mixtures such as glycerin, honey and lemon.
What is a cough?

A cough is an automatic (reflex) response to irritation of the airways in the lungs. The airways in your lungs can become irritated by a number of things - for example, too many secretions, infections, irritant gases, and allergens, or too much dust, or smoke.

Having a cough is the main symptom of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).  However a cough can also be a symptom of other conditions such as asthma or other lung diseases.

This leaflet only discusses cough medicines when used to treat coughs caused by an URTI. It assumes you are confident that you know you have not got anything more serious or another cause for your cough. Seek medical advice if you are unsure.

When you have a cough caused by an URTI, it is usually described as being either a chesty cough or a dry cough. If you have a chesty cough this usually means that your lungs are producing more phlegm (mucus) than normal, because you have an infection, and you are coughing up this extra mucus. If you have a dry cough this usually means that you are coughing a lot but there is no extra mucus when you cough.
